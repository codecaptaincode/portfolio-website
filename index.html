            Hello! I’m Sienna Shepherd, an aspiring software engineer located in NYC. I’m currently learning essential tools and technologies to embark on my journey in software development. For as long as I can remember, I have always been interested in how technology works and how to work on solutions for problems I’ve encountered. What I love about software engineering is the intersection of technology with creativity and logic. My goal is to create meaningful and impactful technologies that help improve people’s lives.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have a varied work experience, from customer service jobs to hospital work. I believe my diversified background is an asset, as I’ve learned how to work with all sorts of folks and can quickly adapt to any situation that arises. Even though I am just getting started in the tech field, I already have a drive to learn as much as I can. I approach challenges with curiosity, and grow from my struggles and missteps. My desire to make a difference with the work that I do is powerful, and I look forward to honing the skills I learn into real solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I am not learning code, I enjoy exploring the vibrant city that surrounds me in NYC. I find inspiration from the energy all around. From the diverse groups of people, the amazing food and events, and being able to be my true self, I wouldn’t want to be anywhere else. I love cozying up on the couch with a good book or video game, and I greatly enjoy creating music, as I have just started playing guitar along with writing songs. Playing with my dog, Bear, also brings me joy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thanks for learning a little about me. If you’d like to connect, my GitHub, LinkedIn, and email are below. Have a great day!
